# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. In order to complete this task, I used 6 different methods, which are:

1. Naive Random Oversampling
2. SMOTE Oversampling
3. Cluster Centroid Undersampling
4. SMOTEENN Sampling
5. Balanced Random Forest Classifying
6. Easy Ensemble Classifying

Through each of these methods, I split my data into training and testing datasets, and compiled accuracy scores, confusion matries, and classification reports as my results.

## Results

### Naive Random Oversampling

* Accuracy Score: 67.4%
* Precision High Risk: 1%
* Precision Low Risk: 100%
* Recall High Risk: 72%
* Recall Low Risk: 63%
